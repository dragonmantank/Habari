First paragraph<a href="#123-asterisk">*</a> has a couple sentences in 
it. This is the second sentence.

The second paragraph has three sentences. There is one more sentence 
after this one. This is the third sentence.

That's the end of the article proper. Now for the silly pseudo-footnote 
I always add now.
