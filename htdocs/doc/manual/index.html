		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>These documents are intended for basic information on installing, upgrading and base use. As development continues, additional information will be added. For more comprehensive documentation, visit the <a class="externalLink" href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Main_Page" title="External link to http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Main_Page" target="_blank">main Habari wiki</a>.</p>
		<h2>About Habari</h2>
		<p>Habari intends to represent a fresh start to the idea of blogging. The system will be fast, easy to use, and easy to modify. New users should have no problem using and enjoying Habari. Advanced users should have no problem tweaking Habari to do exactly what they need it to do.</p>
		<h2>What Does Habari Mean?</h2>
"Habari" is a Swahili word that means "what's the news?" It's similar to the English "What's up?" or the Spanish "Qué pasa?" The typical response is "mzuri sana", which means "very good."
		<h2>How Will it be Different?</h2>
		<p>Habari is being written with a firm understanding of the current state of blogging. Most other blogging packages have been around long enough that their responses to things like comment spam and Digg site overloads are bolted on after the fact; whereas Habari is being written from the beginning to take these things -- and more -- into account.</p>
		<p>Habari strongly favors open, standard, and documented protocols. Atom, being both open and documented, is the prefered syndication format, and the Atom Publishing Protocol is the prefered means of remote communication with your site. This is a core feature, and not a plugin.</p>
		<p>Habari is being written specifically for modern web hosting environments, and uses modern object-oriented programming techniques. Using these recent but well-established additions to the PHP language allows Habari to make use of PDO, enabling prepared statements for all interactions with the database. This greatly reduces the system's vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. This is just one of many benefits of modern object-oriented techniques.</p>
		<p>Those are just a few of the technical differences, but a major component of what makes Habari different is its community participation model. Users who demonstrate a consistent level of quality contributions to the project are granted more privileges within the project.</p>
		<h2>Our Process</h2>
		<h3>Meritocracy</h3>
		<p>Following the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy/" title="External link to http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy/" target="_blank">meritocracy</a> model advocated by the Apache Software Foundation, the Habari project rewards contributors with decision making privilege in the project. Regular participants should be able to influence the direction of the project to which they dedicate their time and talent. The requirement for participation will be something of a moving target over time, but the barrier to entry should never be so high that dedicated people are excluded.</p>
		<h3>Transparency</h3>
		<p>A fundamental aspect of successful open source projects is transparency. Decisions are made in the public's eye, and discussion and deliberation takes place in the open. The Habari project pursues transparency by using the Google issues tracker to maintain a record of proposed changes, and discussion associated with those changes. All proposals -- whether for code, documentation, visual style, etc -- are logged through the issues tracker for public scrutiny and input.</p>
		<h3>Licensing</h3>
		<p>All contributions to Habari will acquire the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" title="External link to http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache
		License</a>, which is a modified version of the Apache License. For those unfamiliar with this license, the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html" title="External link to http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html" target="_blank">Apache License FAQ
		page</a> should answer most of your questions.</p>
		<p>Developers contributing to the Habari project itself should note that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion shall be under the terms and conditions of the Habari license, without any additional terms or conditions. However, plugins and themes designed to work with Habari are not required to have the same license as Habari itself.</p>

		<h1>What's New</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Habari Version 0.6!</p>
		<p>This latest release of Habari contains some major improvements and feature changes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ACL ( Access Control Lists ) support is introduced. With ACL, not only does Habari have support for users, group support has been added. Groups can be assigned specific rights that limit what parts of your site the groups members can access, ranging from only being able to read and comment on published posts ( anonymous users ) to being able to do anything on the site ( administrators ), and everything in between. This support is fully transparent to single-user sites, but can make life much easier for sites with multiple authors and user classes.</li>
			<li>There have been improvements to the admin interface.</li>
			<li>Sites that use SQLite as the storage database should see an increase in performance.</li>
			<li>UTF8 support has been improved. For previous users of Habari, part of the upgrade process is to ensure the database is utilizing UTF8 properly.</li>
			<li>Support for HiEngine, Habari's theme templating system, has been improved. Theme creators now have the option of creating good looking themes using either raw PHP calls, or HiEngine templating.</li>
			<li>Help support for plugins in the admin interface.</li>
			<li>Tag support is still built in, but the tag drawer has been moved to a plugin to improve the publish page performance for sites with hundreds of tags.</li>
			<li>The format of Habari's configuration file has changed. For those who have left it writable, the upgrade will be transparent. For those who have made it read only, it is recommended that it be made writable before upgrading, then set back to read only. If you don't wish to do this, see the <a href="#upgrading" title="Upgrade Instructions">upgrading instructions</a> for details.</li>
			<li>The Serendipity importer no longer ships with Habari. An importer for WordPress databases up through version 2.7.1 is included. The importer has had many improvements in this version.</li>
			<li>Habari now ships with a plugin that allows you to create private posts. With this plugin enabled, you can make a post available for reading to only a selected group of readers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
		<p>Almost 1100 bug fixes and improvements have been made since the last release, but as with any piece of software issues and enhancement requests remain. For full details see Habari's <a href="http://trac.habariproject.org/habari/timeline" title="External link to http://trac.habariproject.org/habari/timeline" target="_blank">change management system</a>.</p>
		<p>Of specific note, PostgreSQL support has not been fully updated in version 0.6. This is primarily due to lack of participants in the project with ability and resources for development and testing of that detabase engine. We welcome users of Postgres to submit patches and test future changes in the hope to include support for new installs and upgrades of Postgres in a point release of 0.6. However, it is currently advised that users currently running 0.5.2 with Postgres do not upgrade to 0.6.</p>

		<p>On behalf of the community, we give our warmest thanks to the developers and contributors who made this Habari release possible.</p>

		<h2>Project Questions</h2>
		<h3>What does "habari" mean?</h3>
		<p>"Habari" is a Swahili word that means "what's the news?" It's similar to the English "What's up?" or the Spanish "¿Qué pasa?" The typical response is "nzuri sana", which means "very good."</p>
		<h3>How is this different from the eleventy billion other blog packages?</h3>
		<p>It's true that there are tons of blogging software solutions from which to choose. Each has their place, and their legion of ardent followers.</p>
		<p>Habari is being written with a firm understanding of the current state of blogging. Most other blogging packages have been around long enough that their responses to things like comment spam and Digg site overloads are bolted on after the fact; whereas Habari is being written from the beginning to take these things -- and more -- into account.</p>
		<p>Habari strongly favors open, standard, and documented protocols. Atom, being both open and documented, is the prefered syndication format, and the Atom Publishing Protocol is the prefered means of remote communication with your site. This is a core feature, and not a plugin.</p>
		<p>Habari is being written specifically for modern web hosting environments, and uses modern object-oriented programming techniques. Using these recent but well-established additions to the PHP language allows Habari to make use of PDO, enabling prepared statements for all interactions with the database. This greatly reduces the system's vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. This is just one of many benefits of modern object-oriented techniques.</p>
		<p>Those are just a few of the technical differences, but a major component of what makes Habari different is its community participation model. Users who demonstrate a consistent level of quality contributions to the project are granted more privileges within the project.</p>
		<h3>Why not fork an existing project?</h3>
		<p>None of the packages we've tried have really satisfied us, so in the fine tradition of open source software we're trying to scratch our own itch.</p>
		<p>To be sure, there's a lot that many blog packages do right, and we'd be foolish to re-invent the wheel simply to be different. But many existing blog packages have made fundamental decisions that limit what can be done, or how, with the system. Rather than try to work around those limitations, or try to remove what's broken, we'd prefer to start fresh and import those ideas that are good.</p>
		<h2>How is Habari licensed?</h2>
		<p>Habari uses a modified version of the Apache License (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). For those unfamiliar with this license, the Apache License FAQ page] should answer most of your questions.</p>
		<blockquote>Developers contributing to the Habari project itself should note that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion shall be under the terms and conditions of the Habari license, without any additional terms or conditions. However, plugins and themes designed to work with Habari are not required to have the same license as Habari itself.</blockquote>
		<p>You can find our license included in the source, and http://svn.habariproject.org/habari/trunk/LICENSE in our code repository.</p>
		<h3>Why HTML vs XHTML</h3>
		<p>A consensus amongst project members concluded a thorough discussion as to the merits of the two DOC types, and what would be appropriate for the Admin pages of Habari. The conclusion was that HTML was the "proper" way, however, end users are welcome to serve their pages in any way they prefer by declaring the DOC type in their theme. A more comprehensive outline of the discussion, culled from the information in the original discussion is provided.</p>

		<h2>Running Habari</h2>
		<h3>Will Habari work with my web host?</h3>
		<p>Habari should work with any web host that supports the above requirements. A list of web hosts where Habari has been tested and run successfully can be found at Supported Hosts.</p>
		<h3>What are the system requirements?</h3>
		<p>Habari is a modern solution for blogging, and requires modern software. To successfully use Habari, you will need:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Web Server - (Apache, lighttpd and nginx have been tested successfully.</li>
			<li>PHP 5.2.x or above - Habari will not work with PHP 4.</li>
			<li>PHP Data Objects support. Depending on the database you are using, the following pdo extensions need to be enabled.</li>
			<li>php_pdo_mysql</li>
			<li>php_pdo_sqlite</li>
			<li>Database - MySQL, PostgresSQL, and SQLite are supported.</li>
			<li>The following extensions enabled in PHP.</li>
			<li>hash</li>
			<li>iconv</li>
			<li>tokenizer</li>
			<li>simplexml</li>
			<li>mbstring</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Does Habari work with PostgreSQL?</h3>
		<p>Support for PostgreSQL introduced in version 0.5 of Habari. But this support was not fully updated in 0.6 (see <a href="#whatsnew" title="What's New">What's New</a>).</p>
		<h3>Does using SQLite as my database have any special requirements?</h3>
		<p>SQLite is a single file database that creates temporary files in the directory which contains your database. As a result, your web server must have write access to the directory in which your database exists. If you do not designate a specific directory in your Habari configuration, the default directory in which your database file is created is the directory in which you installed Habari.</p>

		<h2>Contributing Questions</h2>
		<h3>How can I help?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Open new issues on our issue tracker describing problems you experience, or to request new features.</li>
		<li>Join the Google Group(s) in which you have the most interest, and start sharing!
			<ul>
				<li>The habari-users group is for end user support, and general discussion.</li>
				<li>The habari-dev group is for nitty-gritty implementation discussions of the code, database schemas, and the like.</li>
				<li>The habari-svn group is a way to track the development activity of the source code. You can review the commit logs, and monitor changes as they occur.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How do I add my code changes to the project?</h3>
		<p>If you would like to work on a feature or bug fix, there is a best practice for getting your changes into the process.</p>
		<p>Regardless of the type of fix/change, first create an issue in the issue tracker describing your proposed change. Allowing the group to review your proposal could save you the time of implementing something that is being done as part of a larger task, and could gain you the insight or help of other people who are interested in what you're doing.</p>
		<p>As you write your code, review Habari's coding standards to get acquainted to how your code should be formatted. As you prepare your changes, ask for review on the development mailing list as often as you need it.</p>
		<p>When your changes are complete, file code changes as a diff in the issue that you're tracking, and attach any associated files. Be sure to mention how the files are to be applied if there are any special considerations. Your issue will be reviewed, and if suitable, will be applied in the code repository.</p>
