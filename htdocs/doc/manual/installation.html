<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
		<p>Habari has a few <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Installation" title="Installation">Server Requirements</a>, which you will need to meet to be able to run Habari. If you have what is required, (or better), you are good to go! As Habari is still in development, no guarantees are made that these are fully stable versions, or that updating won't break the current database structure.
		</p><p>To install the latest stable version of Habari:
		</p>

<ul><li> Download <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/download" class="external free" title="http://habariproject.org/en/download" rel="nofollow">the current release</a> and unzip the Habari package.
</li><li> If you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, obtain the connection settings needed below, or create a database for Habari on your web server.
</li><li> Upload Habari files on your web server.
</li><li> Point your web browser at <u>http://yoursite.com/</u> (the location of your Habari files on your server) to begin installation with the Database Setup. </li></ul>
<p>The Habari installer initially presents you with a choice of languages that it will use for the interface.  Select the correct locale code from the list for your language of choice.  The default selection is "en-us", which is English, United States.
</p><p>Clicking the question mark at the top of any section of the installer will reveal more information about each field in that section.

</p><p>Depending on the Database Type you set, you may need to enter some of the following information:
</p>
<ul><li> Database Type: You can choose between MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Your hosting company should be able to tell you what you should use.
</li><li> Database Host: Again your hosting company should have provided this information when you first joined.
</li><li> Username: This is the username used to connect Habari to the MySQL database.
</li><li> Password: This is the password used to connect Habari to the MySQL database.
</li><li> Database Name: Again your hosting company should have provided this information when you first joined.
</li><li> Table Prefix: You will only need to change this if you have more than one version of Habari installed.
</li></ul>
<p>The Site Configuration settings you will need to set are:
</p>

<ul><li> Site Name: The name of your blog.
</li><li> Username: The name or alias you wish to use to administer your blog. This should not be the same as the username for the database.
</li><li> Password: The password associated to the above Username. Enter this in the second box, just to make sure you get it right.
</li><li> Admin Email: This is the email address associated with the above Username. Habari will email you to let you know everything is working.
</li></ul>
<p>The installer recommends several plugins upon initial install.  These plugins are checked in the next section, Plugin Activation.  Additional optional plugins are included in the core installation, but these plugins are not checked by default.  If there are additional plugin present in addition, Habari will list these here as well.  Choose the plugins that should be activated upon installation by checking the box next to each.
</p><p>Conclude the installation process by clicking the "Install Habari" button.  When Habari completes processing, installation is complete.
</p><p>The End! Habari should now be installed.
</p><p><a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Installation" title="Installation">Full Installation Instructions</a> are available, including some details of how to adjust your settings for different web servers and specific configuration information for several popular hosting companies.
</p><p>If you are happy to use the current development version of Habari, the full instructions explain how to access the Habari subversion repository; however, for most normal users you will need to download the latest stable version of Habari.
